        If your applicaiton uses site and subsite and each sub site is useing
        another resource manager, the relative subsite path could get used
        as namespace. Then you uri could look like:

        And the sub site could be set to something like: "root/subsite"

        A production setup does not require any special uri setup in general.
        It fully depends on your web servers rewrite rule and your extracted
        resource location. You will probably use a sub domain like:

        http://%(namespace)s.foobar.com/%(version)s/@@

        or with an additional namespace:

        http://cdn.foobar.com/%(namespace)s/%(version)s/@@

    Note, take care if you use SSL, make sure that you use a wildcard
    certificate which is valid for different subdomains. This is a new kind of
    certificate which only some certificate seller offer. One of such a seller
